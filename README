smbpipe (bash version)

smpipe is an openbox pipe menu for accessing (mount, list, etc.) samba shares.
Shares containing spaces are now correctly handled.
Changing or creating of credential files sets the right permissions (folder 700, file 600).
Deleting of users (credential file) is supported.
Shares are mounted using sudo, but permissions are set so that every user can access the mounted shares.
Shares are accessible through different logins and an anonymous login (guest).

Usage:
Add something like this to your menu.xml
<menu id="smbpipebash" label="Samba Shares (Bash)" execute="sh /path/to/smbpipe_bash" />
If you want your filemanager to open the share upon mounting use:
<menu id="smbpipebash" label="Samba Shares (Bash)" execute="sh /path/to/smbpipe_bash --filemanager yourfilemanager" />

Dependencies:
bash
smbclient
sudo
urxvt (for opening a terminal window asking for a password/username/...) (should be easily replacable)
xclip (to copy the url for CUPS to the clipboard)
A solution for the problem with spaces is now present.
